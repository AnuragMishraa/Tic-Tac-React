# Tic-Tac-React
A tic-tac-toe game developed on React would consist of a game board component that renders a 3x3 grid of squares, each of which is its own component. The game logic would be implemented in the parent component, which would keep track of the current player, the state of each square, and whether the game has been won or is a draw.

## Getting started
To play the game, you can either:

Visit the deployed version at (https://anuragmishraa.github.io/Tic-Tac-React/)

Clone the repository and run the game locally on your machine

To run the game locally, you'll need to have Node.js and NPM (or Yarn) installed on your machine. 


Once you have those, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/AnuragMishraa/Tic-Tac-React.git

Change into the project directory using cd tic-tac-toe

Install the dependencies using npm install or yarn install

Start the game using npm start or yarn start

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## How to play
To play the game, simply click on any empty square to mark it with your symbol (either "X" or "O"). The game will automatically switch to the other player's turn, and continue until one player wins, or the game is a draw.

### `Features`
This game was built using React, and includes the following features:

A simple, intuitive user interface
Responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices
Game logic that checks for wins and draws, and updates the state of the game accordingly
A "new game" button that resets the game and starts a new round
